RBSURpred
==========
RBSURpred is a extension of the RBSURpred predictor for predicting absolute accessible surface area of residues 
in protein. The predictor is  based on regularized exact regression 
method using 3rd order polynomial as kernel and  with different metaheuristics for the
optimization of weights. It takes protein sequence (standard FASTA format) 
as input and outputs per residue predicted ASA values. This software 
also predicts secondary structure internally to use the probabilities
of three types of secondary structure (helix, coil and beta).

Input Format Guidelines
=======================

- Paste test protein sequence in directory "FASTA"
	- follow standard FASTA format: >header and FASTA sequence
	- multiple proteins should be placed in separate FASTA files
	- name format: 'id.fasta'

- Paste protein id (no extension) in id_list.txt file in folder named "list"
	
NOTE: Program is strictly dependent on the input file format.
